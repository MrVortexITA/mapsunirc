This software aims to create an interface, executable on any platform, which helps users (particularly students, teachers, staff and visitors) to move between the offices, structures and classrooms of the "Mediterranea" University. of Reggio Calabria.
Since the university website is beautiful, but complicated to reach, especially for new users, as it is difficult to understand without having a real site map.
Furthermore, resources are often found at levels 4 and 5 of nesting and are difficult for a novice user to understand.
By using a simple visual approach, following simple paths or typing keywords, you can reach the resource you are looking for much faster.
The hope of this volunteer programmer is that all universities in the world can, by implementing the code written here, find solutions to the same problem that afflicts this university.

This software is licensed completely free of charge for modification for improvement and customization.
However, the exchange of information to improve the code and make the approved improvements accessible to all would be appreciated.
